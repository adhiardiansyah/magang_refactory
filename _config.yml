#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I'm interested in website development, especially focus on the back end. I'm also interested in managing social media accounts. I have 2 years of experience managing student association organization accounts. Apart from managing the accounts, i also helped to create contents. Sometimes i also make an instagram filter on my instagram account. I get a lot of appreciation from instagram filters, my filters has been used by several celebgrams till i got more than 40 million impressions now.
